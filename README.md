# Analyzing Seattle AirBnb Data
Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree - Project Blog Post

## Project Motivation
For this project I picked a Seattle AirBnb dataset to better understand:
1. What is the average price per months and days of the week?
2. Which neighborhood is the most expensive one?
3. What property types are most popular?

## File descriptions
Data:
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:
- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

Code:
- seattle_airbnb_analysis.ipynb

## Results
The results of the analysis can be found in a blog post <a href="https://medium.com/@jnaletil/seattle-airbnb-data-analysis-251768055492" target="_blank">here</a>
